					<h2>About Bloodlines</h2>
					<p>
						Bloodlines is a browser based multiplayer game that was insiperd by the board game called Risk 
						and the classic PC game Warlords. Our team has taken the best parts from both of these games and 
						incorporated them into a modern web based platform to create a game called Bloodlines.

					<h4>Multiplayer</h4>
					<p>
						When you resurect a classic game such as Warloards, it is essintal that new 
						technology is incorprated into the product being developed. It is also equaly important
						that you identify any of the major flaws the game may have had so that you can try to
						address the cause of why people lost interest in the game in the first place.
						We believe we have done both. The PC game warlords had two major flaws, multiplayer options and
						overall length of game. The only multiplayer option available was called host seat where up to 
						four players could play at the same computer.  With Bloodlines we have developed a true multiplayer
						interface that will allow users from all over the world to play togther.  In order to make this work
						we also implemented a system that will enforce a maxium amout of time per turn so that there will always
						be a ending to the game within a reseasonable amount of time.

					<h4>Game Play</h4>
					<p>
						To ensure the best experience possibale for players at any level we have incorperated a simialr game
						play style that the board game RISK uses. Each game can have up to four players which will start with a 
						set number of units. Each player will take a turn placing a unit within a section of a terrioty that is not 
						already occupied.  At the end of each turn the player will be placed in a waiting lobby where they will be able
						to chat with the other players that are not activly taking their turn.  Once all of the territories are occupied 
						the real battle will begin.
